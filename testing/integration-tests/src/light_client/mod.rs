//! # Light Client Initialization and Testing
//!
//! The initialization process of the light client can be slow, especially when
//! it needs to synchronize with a local running node for each individual
//! #[tokio::test] in subxt. To optimize this process, a subset of tests is
//! exposed to ensure the light client remains functional over time. Currently,
//! these tests are placed under an unstable feature flag.
//!
//! Ideally, we would place the light client initialization in a shared static
//! using `OnceCell`. However, during the initialization, tokio::spawn is used
//! to multiplex between subxt requests and node responses. The #[tokio::test]
//! macro internally creates a new Runtime for each individual test. This means
//! that only the first test, which spawns the substrate binary and synchronizes
//! the light client, would have access to the background task. The cleanup process
//! would destroy the spawned background task, preventing subsequent tests from
//! accessing it.
//!
//! To address this issue, we can consider creating a slim proc-macro that
//! transforms the #[tokio::test] into a plain #[test] and runs all the tests
//! on a shared tokio runtime. This approach would allow multiple tests to share
//! the same background task, ensuring consistent access to the light client.
//!
//! For more context see: https://github.com/tokio-rs/tokio/issues/2374.
//!
